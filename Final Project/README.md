This project aims to leverage Vision Transformers (ViT) to classify plant health conditions based on leaf
images, which will address the need for accurate large-scale plant health condition detection in
agriculture. This project combines my interest in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and their
practical applications to address real-life problems.
